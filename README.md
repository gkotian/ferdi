> ü§¥üèΩ Hard-fork of [Franz](https://github.com/meetfranz/franz), adding awesome features and removing unwanted ones.

Ferdi is a desktop app that helps you organize how you use your favourite apps by combining them into one application. It is based on Franz - a software already used by thousands of people - with the difference that Ferdi gives you many additional features and doesn't restrict its usage! Furthermore, Ferdi is compatible with your existing Franz account, so you can continue right where you left off. Please find out more about Ferdi and its features on [getferdi.com](https://getferdi.com).

## Troubleshooting [recipes](https://github.com/getferdi/recipes)

<details>
<summary>Toggle answer</summary>

One of the issues being raised by the users of Ferdi is that certain service-functionalities do not work. A good example of this is either the unread count (badge) stops working for specific services or the gmail logins don't work anymore. (These are just 2 of the most common problems reported).

Since we (the contributors to Ferdi) also eat our own food, we use Ferdi as our day-to-day communication app - and most likely have faced the same/similar issue. As a first step before filing an issue, we request you to follow these simple steps to see if the issue gets fixed. These recipes will get automatically upgraded when you upgrade to the newer versions of Ferdi, but to get new recipes **between** Ferdi releases, this documentation is quite useful.

- Make sure you are on the latest version of Ferdi. As of this writing, since the nightly CI packaging process is broken, we request you to download the latest nightly from the link in [Nightly releases](#nightly-releases) section.
- Stop Ferdi
- Navigate to the Ferdi profile folder in your respective installation in your file explorer application.

```bash
  Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Ferdi/recipes
  Windows: %appdata%/Ferdi/recipes
  Linux: ~/.config/Ferdi/recipes
```

- Delete the folder of the service that is causing your issue - _in the file explorer application_. (Please note that if you have manually modified any files here, it will be your responsibility to merge the changes with the latest version of the recipe (or you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/pulls) for the same).
- Open a browser and navigate to the [recipes](https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/tree/master/recipes) repository page, and copy ALL the files for your erroneous service into your local machine at the location that you deleted in the previous step
- Restart Ferdi (this should upgrade your recipes to the latest working version that the contributors have fixed)
- If this process did not fix the issue, please log a detailed bug report [here](https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/issues)
- _Note:_ An automated process to perform these steps is being ideated and tracked [here](https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi/issues/1302)
